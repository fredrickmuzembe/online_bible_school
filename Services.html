    <h3>IS THE SIGNIFICANT ABOUT STUDYING THE BIBLE STUDY ?? :</h3>
    <p> Knowing this first of all that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:20-21) The Bible
        isn’t an easy book. It was written by God in an ancient time through people of different languages and cultures than our own, whose immediate audiences were different from us in many ways. It’s also a book written by God about God and the work
        he has done and he is doing in the world.</p>
    <p><b> A work by such a divine Author, on such an immense topic, should be difficult to fully comprehend. So we’ll need to study and wrestle with God’s words, but it’s worth it, and here are five reasons why:,</b>
        <p> 1. Bible study illuminates our daily reading. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
            (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
            <p>
                Bible study works together with our daily time in Scripture. Daily Bible reading maintains our connection with God through his written Word. It reminds us of his character, promises, our dependence on him, and our future together. It familiarizes us with,
                and helps us grasp, the whole story of Scripture; the whole counsel of God and it keeps our souls energized.</p>
            <p>But Bible study deepens and expands our understanding of specific Bible passages; it helps us sort through hard concepts and gives insight into the context of the Bible. Ideally, our times in deeper study will result in more fulfilling times
                of daily reading, as what we have gleaned through in-depth study informs our regular time in the Word.</p><br> 2. Bible study protects us from twisting the truth.</p>
        <p>Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction,
            as they do the other Scriptures. (2 Peter 3:15b-16)</p>
        <p>The Word of God is challenging, and because sin is a power at work against man, it’s inevitable that people will twist the words of God for their own purposes. This sort of manipulation will be confusing and distracting to those who do not regularly
            seek a fuller grasp of God’s Word through study. Study of the Bible is important for the health of a believer. Someone who reads daily but never spends times in study is like a person who eats regular, nourishing meals but never bothers to
            discover why the meals are nourishing: You gain some benefit, but can’t appreciate the components of the meal, nor can you fully apply the concepts of nourishment to other facets of life.</p>
        <p>
            For example, when reading through a verse or book of the Bible, we will get the benefit of its implications on our current experience, but we may miss the meaning of the context in which it was written. This expanded view of the insight of Scripture is
            only available through study.</p><br> 3. Bible study amplifies our service.</p>
    [Apollos] had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila
    heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. (Acts 18:25-26)</p>
    <p>Bible study expands our ability to minister God’s truth. The Bible, written by a living and active God, is a living and active book; anyone who claims to have mastered all its teachings is deluded. Even those with a good grasp of Scripture, and who
        spread the gospel accurately and honestly, can enrich their testimony and comprehension through continued biblical study and instruction. The pursuit of Jesus is a lifelong pursuit, as should be our endeavors to grasp his Word.</p><br>
    <p>4. Bible study opens our understanding. And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. (Luke 24:27)</p>
    <p>
        The Old Testament is rich with promises of Jesus and his work. The New Testament narrative stands on the testimony of the Old. A fuller study of both Testaments gives a greater knowledge of what Jesus fulfilled in his life, death, resurrection, and ascension.
        It also gives hope and strength that Jesus will return to begin his eternal reign. As the Holy Spirit does his work in us, we become more open to God’s wisdom. The men on the road to Emmaus were familiar with Scripture and had even known Jesus
        before his crucifixion. But it wasn’t until after Jesus’ resurrection and his opening the Scriptures to them that they gained a deeper comprehension of Jesus and his work.</p>
    <p>
        There may be work the Spirit needs to do in us before parts of God’s Word open to us. A passage we’ve read multiple times, studied before, and thought we understood may suddenly take on new dimensions through the enlightening of the eyes of our hearts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. Bible study deepens our devotion to Christ. Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. (Acts 17:11) In some ways, Bible study
        is easier than daily reading. Since in-depth study occurs less often, it takes less self-discipline. Bible study also focuses on fewer verses or more refined topics, which may seem more palatable. But Bible study has its challenges. The interaction
        with the text is more intense, making times of study seem more daunting than daily reading. Many people don’t feel qualified to delve into Scripture study, which seems like it should be reserved for pastors and theologians. But Bible study is
        for everyone; we just need a plan.</p>
    <p>
        A simple way to get started on your own is to purchase a study Bible, which have sections before each book explaining the historical context, theme, author, audience, and other details. These Bibles also have commentary alongside the verses that note
        relations to other books of the Bible and explanations of confusing or difficult concepts. However, one of the best ways to study the Bible is to sit under solid preaching, teaching and get involved in a group through your local church. Jesus
        meant for us to encourage each other in spiritual growth, and the study of his Word is one of the greatest ways we can grow to love him together.</p><br> Importance of Prayer



    <h2 style="color:blue;"> <u>2.Online Prayers And Morning Devotions </u></h2>

    , If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. 2 Chronicles 7:14

    <h4>Excerpts from Jim Egli “Small Groups Big Impact” </h4>


    <h4> You Want a Healthy Growing Small Group, Pray! </h4>

    <p>The practice that impacts the health and growth of a small group the most is the prayer life of its leader. If you walk away from this book with only one insight, perhaps it should be this: If you want a vibrant and growing small group, consistently
        take time to grow in your relationship with God!” </p>

    <p>The prayer life of the leader correlates positively with the other three dimensions of small group health—Reach, Care, and Empower. Leaders who pray more have groups that are more outward focused. Their groups also experience more community and are
        more engaged in mobilizing new leadership. But the prayer life of the leader has a particularly strong impact on the evangelistic effectiveness of a group. </p>

    <p>When leaders have a growing prayer life, more people are drawn to their group and into lifechanging relationship with Christ. Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising, but the amount of difference that a leader’s prayer life makes on a group’s evangelistic
        impact is startling. Our research reveals that leaders with a strong prayer life have groups that are more than four times more fruitful evangelistically. Of the leaders with a strong prayer life, 83% reported that their group had seen someone
        come to Christ in the past 9 months, but only 19% of the leaders with a weak prayer life could say the same.</p>

    <p>If you want others drawn to Jesus and their lives changed, pray. If you want Jesus’ life flowing to you and through you, draw near to him. Life-giving ministry depends on God and his abilities, not on you and your abilities!”
        <p>

            <3>How Are You Spending Your Time? </h3>

                <p>How a small group leader spends his time is pivotal to his group’s health and growth. Time spent with God and time spent with small group members and non-Christian friends help produce a vibrant small group. On the other hand, we were
                    surprised to discover that the amount of time spent preparing the Bible lesson shows no correlation whatsoever to small group growth. In other words, the leaders who spend five hours preparing the Bible lesson for their groups have
                    groups that grow no faster than the leaders who spend five minutes preparing the lesson! Amazing but true. </p>

                <p></p>It does make a dramatic difference, however, how much time the leader spends praying for his small group meeting. Interestingly, when we asked leaders how much time they spend preparing the lesson and how much time they spend praying
                for their small group meeting, most leaders told us that they spend far more time preparing their lesson than they do praying for their meeting! Few leaders realize that lesson preparation makes a negligible difference in group health
                and growth, but prayer makes a big difference. It is much more important to prepare your heart than it is to prepare your notes!
                <p>



                    <h3>How to pray for your group:</h3>

                    <p>• Ask for the presence of the Holy Spirit in your group. • Pray that God will open people’s hearts to hear His truth. • Pray for authentic community to develop. • Pray for wisdom and strength to lead your group well. • Pray for any
                        requests group members share. </p>
